# Write a procedure download_time which takes as inputs a file size, the
# units that file size is given in, bandwidth and the units for
# bandwidth (excluding per second) and returns the time taken to download 
# the file.
# Your answer should be a string in the form
# "<number> hours, <number> minutes, <number> seconds"

# Some information you might find useful is the number of bits
# in kilobits (kb), kilobytes (kB), megabits (Mb), megabytes (MB),
# gigabits (Gb), gigabytes (GB) and terabits (Tb), terabytes (TB).

#print 2 ** 10      # one kilobit, kb
#print 2 ** 10 * 8  # one kilobyte, kB

#print 2 ** 20      # one megabit, Mb
#print 2 ** 20 * 8  # one megabyte, MB

#print 2 ** 30      # one gigabit, Gb
#print 2 ** 30 * 8  # one gigabyte, GB

#print 2 ** 40      # one terabit, Tb
#print 2 ** 40 * 8  # one terabyte, TB

# Often bandwidth is given in megabits (Mb) per second whereas file size 
# is given in megabytes (MB).
